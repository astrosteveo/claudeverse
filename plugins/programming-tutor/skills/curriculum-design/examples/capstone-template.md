### Guidance & Support

#### Getting Unstuck

If you get stuck:
1. **Review the problem**: Clearly identify what's not working
2. **Check documentation**: Review relevant module lessons
3. **Simplify**: Can you solve a simpler version of the problem?
4. **Debug systematically**: Add print statements, check assumptions
5. **Ask for hints**: Use `/tutor:hint` for Socratic guidance

#### When to Ask for Help

Request hints when:
