### Starter Code (Optional)

[Provide minimal starter code if needed, or indicate "Start from scratch"]

```[language]
# Optional starter structure
# Remove if learners should start from scratch
```

### Data Structures

Consider these data structures for your implementation:

**Option 1**: [Data structure approach 1]
