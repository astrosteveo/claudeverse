# [Feature Name] - Iteration [N] MVP Scope

## Core Value Proposition

What's the ONE thing this iteration must do to prove the concept works?

> [Single sentence describing the core value]

---

## Research Findings

Summary of research conducted before scoping (do NOT skip this section):

### Current Best Practices
- [What the community/industry currently recommends]

### Libraries/Dependencies Evaluated
| Option | Status | Last Updated | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| [Library 1] | [Active/Deprecated/Unmaintained] | [Date] | [Why chosen/rejected] |
| [Library 2] | [Active/Deprecated/Unmaintained] | [Date] | [Why chosen/rejected] |

### Codebase Patterns
- [Existing patterns in this codebase that we should follow]
- [Conventions already established]

### Key Decisions from Research
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale based on research]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale based on research]

## MVP Definition

### In Scope (Must Have)

These items are **required** for this iteration to be complete:

- [ ] **Capability 1**: [Description]
  - Acceptance: [How we know it's done]
- [ ] **Capability 2**: [Description]
  - Acceptance: [How we know it's done]
- [ ] **Capability 3**: [Description]
  - Acceptance: [How we know it's done]

### Acceptable Simplifications

Things we're intentionally keeping simple for MVP:

- [ ] [Simplification 1] - Full version deferred because: [reason]
- [ ] [Simplification 2] - Full version deferred because: [reason]

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Deferred)

These items are **intentionally excluded** from this iteration:

| Item | Rationale | Target Iteration |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| [Feature X] | [Why not now] | Iteration 2 |
| [Feature Y] | [Why not now] | Iteration 3 |
| [Feature Z] | [Why not now] | Future |

---

## Success Criteria

How do we know this iteration is DONE?

1. [ ] [Measurable criterion 1]
2. [ ] [Measurable criterion 2]
3. [ ] [Measurable criterion 3]
4. [ ] All tests passing
5. [ ] Coverage meets threshold (80% line)

---

## Session Feasibility Check

### Estimated Complexity

- [ ] **Low** - Can complete in < 1 hour
- [ ] **Medium** - Can complete in 1-3 hours
- [ ] **High** - May need multiple sessions (consider splitting scope)

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Blocker? |
|------------|--------|----------|
| [Dependency 1] | [Available/Missing] | [Yes/No] |
| [Dependency 2] | [Available/Missing] | [Yes/No] |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Low/Med/High] | [How to handle] |

## Iteration Roadmap

### This Iteration (MVP)
- [Core capability 1]
- [Core capability 2]

### Iteration 2 (Enhanced)
- [Deferred item 1]
- [Deferred item 2]

### Iteration 3+ (Polish)
- [Future enhancements]
- [Nice-to-haves]
