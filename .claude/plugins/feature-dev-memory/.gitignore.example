# Example .gitignore for .claude/memory/feature-specs/
# Copy this to .claude/memory/feature-specs/.gitignore if you want to customize
# what gets committed to version control

# Option 1: Ignore all memory files (keep specs local only)
# *
# !.gitignore

# Option 2: Keep only architecture specs, ignore explorations
# explorations/

# Option 3: Keep everything (default - just don't create .gitignore)
# (no patterns needed)

# Option 4: Keep only the latest architecture
# *
# !.gitignore
# !latest-architecture.md
