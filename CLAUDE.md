### TDD Principles

1. **Specs First** - Document requirements before coding
2. **Tests First** - Write failing tests before implementation
3. **Minimal Code** - Only implement what tests require
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
5. **Document Decisions** - Use ADRs for significant choices
